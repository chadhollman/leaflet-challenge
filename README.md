# Earthquake / Tectonic Plate Mapping
--------------
## The following project uses data from the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, to visualize earthquake data: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson
## It also pulls from the following dataset in order to map tectonic plate locations: https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates
The end result is in interactive map which displays earthquakes with data markers that reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color, as well as the tectonic plate dataset.

Both datasets are in separate overlays that can be turned on and off independently
